# Product Guide - Headless Firebase CMS

## Initial Concept
A headless CMS built with Next.js, Firebase, and Cloudinary, designed to provide a flexible and scalable backend for content-driven applications.

## Target Audience
- **Developers:** The primary users who will integrate the CMS into various frontend applications and manage the technical implementation.

## Core Goals
- **Flexible & Scalable Backend:** Provide a robust infrastructure that can grow with the needs of diverse frontend applications.
- **Decoupled Architecture:** Ensure a clean separation between content management and content delivery.

## Key Features
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Granular permission management for different user levels to ensure secure data handling.
- **Dynamic Content Modeling:** Empower users to define and modify content structures (schemas) without changing backend code.
- **Integrated Media Management:** Seamless media handling using Cloudinary for storage, optimization, and delivery.

## Delivery Method
- **REST API:** Content is primarily exposed via standardized RESTful endpoints to ensure compatibility across a wide range of platforms and frameworks.
