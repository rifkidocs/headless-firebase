- **Integrated Media Management:** Seamless media handling using Cloudinary for storage, optimization, and delivery.
- **Automated API Documentation:** Integrated interactive documentation using Scalar, providing a clear reference for developers.
- **Dynamic Social Previews:** Automated Open Graph and Twitter metadata generation with dynamic, branded preview images for all content and pages.
