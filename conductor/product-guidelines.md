# Product Guidelines - Headless Firebase CMS

## Prose Style
- **Technical & Precise:** All interface text and documentation should prioritize accuracy and clarity. Use standard industry terminology and provide clear, unambiguous instructions for developers.

## Visual Identity
- **Clean & Functional:** The admin dashboard should feature a minimalist design with high contrast. Data density and layout clarity are prioritized over purely decorative elements to ensure an efficient workspace for administrators.

## User Experience (UX) Principles
- **Visual Feedback:** The system must provide immediate and clear confirmation for all user interactions. This includes using toast notifications for success/error messages and visible loading states during asynchronous operations.
- **Contextual Assistance:** Complex features, such as dynamic schema building and granular permission settings, should be accompanied by tooltips or inline help to guide users and prevent errors.

## Design & Implementation Standards
- **Component Consistency:** Leverage Radix UI primitives for complex components (dialogs, menus, selects) to ensure high accessibility and consistent behavior.
- **Styling Patterns:** Use Tailwind CSS for all styling, adhering to a utility-first approach while maintaining a consistent color palette and spacing system throughout the application.
